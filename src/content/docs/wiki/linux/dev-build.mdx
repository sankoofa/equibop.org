To use custom user plugins or test new features, you can point Equibop to a local development build of Equicord.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Equibop, you must have a local version of Equicord built on your system.

1.  **Build Equicord from Source**: Follow the official [Building from Source guide](https://docs.equicord.org/building-from-source) to clone the repository and install dependencies.

2.  **Add User Plugins**: If you want to use custom plugins, place them in the `src/userplugins` folder as described in the [Installing User Plugins guide](https://docs.equicord.org/plugins#installing-user-plugins).

## Configuring Equibop

Once your local build is ready, you need to tell Equibop where to find it:

1.  Open **Equibop Settings**.
2.  Navigate to **Developer Settings**.
3.  Find **Equicord Location** and click **Change**.
4.  Navigate to the folder where you cloned Equicord and select the `dist` folder inside it.
