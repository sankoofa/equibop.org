## Applying custom arguments

Any of the flags listed below can be applied using one of these three methods:

1. **Tray icon:** `Right-click on the Equibop tray icon > Launch arguments`.
2. **Desktop entry:** Edit the `Exec` line in `/usr/share/applications/equibop.desktop`.
3. **Config file:** Add flags to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/equibop-flags.conf` (see [Configuration Details](/wiki/linux/tips/#configuration-details) section).

## Wayland support

Equibop runs as an X11 application by default. You can opt into Wayland in several ways depending on how you run Equibop. To make this permanent, see [Making Command line flags permanent](#making-command-line-flags-permanent).

### Shortcut

```bash
--wayland
```

This is a convenient shortcut that will enable native Wayland behavior and automatically enable features such as:

* `WaylandWindowDecorations`
* `VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL` (hardware acceleration)

> **Manual equivalent:**
>
> ```bash
> --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
> ```

### Ozone automatic hint (alternate)

If you prefer the Ozone auto hint instead of forcing Wayland, use:

```bash
--ozone-platform-hint=auto
```

This is useful when you want Equibop to prefer Wayland when available while still falling back to X11.

### Flatpak users

If you installed Equibop via Flatpak, open **[Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal)** and **deny** the **"X11 windowing system"** permission for Equibop. This ensures the Flatpak targets Wayland instead of X11.

## GNOME tray icon

To enable the tray icon on GNOME, install the [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

## Sandbox control

```bash
--no-sandbox
```

Disables the Chromium sandbox. This is **discouraged** for regular use because it weakens security. Only use it if you understand the risks or if you must run the application as **root**.

## GPU selection

```bash
--force_high_performance_gpu
```

Forces the engine to prefer the discrete GPU (if available) over integrated graphics.

## Middle-click auto scroll

Enable middle-click autoscroll with:

```bash
--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll
```

By default this conflicts with the common Linux behavior where middle-click pastes the primary selection. Fixes by environment:

-   If you are running Equibop in X11 (default), install and run [XMousePasteBlock](https://github.com/milaq/XMousePasteBlock).
-   If you are running Equibop in Wayland, you might be able to disable it in your Desktop settings.
    On GNOME, you can disable it in [Gnome Tweaks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks).

## Making command-line flags permanent

You can persist flags either by editing the `.desktop` file or by creating the flags file described below.

### Find the desktop file

```sh
locate -ib equibop.desktop
```

Common location: `/usr/share/applications/equibop.desktop` (but your distribution may place it elsewhere).

### Edit the Exec line

Open the `.desktop` file with your preferred editor and append the flags after the binary and before `%U` (if present):

```text
Exec=/usr/bin/equibop --ozone-platform-hint=auto %U
```

## Configuration details

Create `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/equibop-flags.conf` to keep persistent flags across updates and desktop entry resets.

* One flag per line or multiple flags on a single line (shell style) are both acceptable.
* Lines starting with `#` are ignored (useful for comments).

Example `equibop-flags.conf`:

```text
# Make Equibop prefer Wayland when available
--wayland

# Prefer discrete GPU
--force_high_performance_gpu

# Enable middle-click autoscroll
--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll
```
