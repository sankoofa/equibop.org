To build Equibop, the standalone client, you must have the following dependencies installed:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh)

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop
cd Equibop

# Install Dependencies
bun install
```

### Build Targets & Options

Equibop can be built or run in several ways:

* **Run without packaging:** `bun start`
* **Package for your OS:** `bun package`
* **Build Linux Pacman package:** `bun package --linux pacman`
* **Package to a directory only:** `bun package:dir`

## Building LibVesktop from Source

**LibVesktop** is a small C++ helper library that Equibop uses on Linux to emit D-Bus events. By default, prebuilt binaries for **x64** and **arm64** are used.

If you prefer to build it from source yourself, follow these steps:

1. **Install build dependencies:**
* **Debian/Ubuntu:** `apt install build-essential python3 curl pkg-config libglib2.0-dev`
* **Fedora:** `dnf install @c-development @development-tools python3 curl pkgconf-pkg-config glib2-devel`

2. **Run the build command:**

```sh
bun buildLibVesktop

```

3. **Finalize:** From now on, building Equibop will prioritize and use your local build of LibVesktop.
