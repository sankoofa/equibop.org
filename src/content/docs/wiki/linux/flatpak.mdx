## Wayland support

See [Tips & Tricks - Wayland Support](/wiki/linux/tips#wayland-support) for information on enabling Wayland support.

## File Access

The Equibop flatpak by default only has access to a limited set of files. This will break Drag & Drop and file pasting.

You can give Equibop access to all your files with [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) or by running the following command:

```sh
flatpak override --filesystem=home:ro org.equicord.equibop
```

## Discord Rich Presence (Game Activity)

If you would like functional Rich Presence, do not use the Flatpak version.

Due to the sandboxed nature of Flatpak, Rich Presence is very limited and will only work for games that use Discord's Game SDK to set your presence.
This is only a very small number of games. Most games get detected by scanning running processes.

Run the following commands to enable support for games using Game SDK:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d
echo 'L %t/discord-ipc-0 - - - - .flatpak/org.equicord.equibop/xdg-run/discord-ipc-0' > ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d/discord-rpc.conf
systemctl --user enable --now systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service

sudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-run/.flatpak/org.equicord.equibop:create --filesystem=xdg-run/discord-ipc-0
flatpak --user override --filesystem=xdg-run/.flatpak/org.equicord.equibop:create --filesystem=xdg-run/discord-ipc-0
```
