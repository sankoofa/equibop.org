## General Troubleshooting & File Issues

* **Corrupted Database or Missing Files:** If `locate` shows a corrupted file read (`pread: Short read (file corrupted? )`) or does not find the file, try searching manually:
    ```sh
    find / -name "equibop.desktop" 2>/dev/null
    ```
    Or check the standard directories: `/usr/share/applications` and `~/.local/share/applications`.
    
* **Persistence after Updates:** If your distro overwrites `/usr/share/applications` on update, prefer the `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/equibop-flags.conf` approach or place a local `.desktop` in `~/.local/share/applications`.

## Nothing happens when trying to start a Screenshare

This means you either have no Screen cast portal, or it's broken. See [XDG Desktop Portal on the Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal) for more information.

## Equibop freezes after getting pinged or messaged

This is due to having no Notification Server on your system. Either [install one](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications)
or disable Desktop Notifications in Discord Notification settings

## Clicking link does not open the web browser

Install `xdg-utils`

## Equibop looks blurry

The most likely cause is that Equibop is running in XWayland; Try running in Wayland instead.

See [Tips & Tricks - Wayland Support](/wiki/linux/tips#wayland-support) for more information.

## Some videos don't play or only play audio

This happens because these videos use the HEVC encoding. Follow these steps to enable support:

1. Verify that you have working **VA-API** with HEVC decode support:
    ```sh
    vainfo 2>/dev/null | grep HEVC | grep VAEntrypointVLD
    ```
    If there is no output, it's not supported.
2. If it's not supported, try to [install it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#Installation) and repeat step 1. You need exactly VA-API, not VDPAU or NVDEC.
3. Run Equibop with the following flags:
    ```sh
    equibop --enable-features=VaapiIgnoreDriverChecks,Vulkan,DefaultANGLEVulkan,VulkanFromANGLE,VaapiOnNvidiaGPUs
    ```
    To make this permanent, see [Tips & Tricks - Making Command Line Flags Permanent](/wiki/linux/tips#making-command-line-flags-permanent).

## No tray icon and cannot repair Equicord

If you are using version **3.1.8** or higher, you can open your favorite terminal and run the command below to repair it:
```sh
equibop -r
```
