## Nothing happens when trying to start a Screenshare

This means you either have no Screen cast portal, or it's broken. See [XDG Desktop Portal on the Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal) for more information.

## Equibop freezes after getting pinged or messaged

This is due to having no Notification Server on your system. Either [install one](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications)
or disable Desktop Notifications in Discord Notification settings

## Clicking link does not open the web browser

Install `xdg-utils`

## Equibop looks blurry

The most likely cause is that Equibop is running in XWayland; Try running in Wayland instead.

See [Tips & Tricks - Wayland Support](/wiki/linux/tips#wayland-support) for more information.

## Some videos don't play or only play audio

This happens because these videos use the HEVC encoding. Follow these steps to enable support:

1. Verify that you have working **VA-API** with HEVC decode support:
    ```sh
    vainfo 2>/dev/null | grep HEVC | grep VAEntrypointVLD
    ```
    If there is no output, it's not supported.
2. If it's not supported, try to [install it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#Installation) and repeat step 1. You need exactly VA-API, not VDPAU or NVDEC.
3. Run Equibop with the following flags:
    ```sh
    equibop --enable-features=VaapiIgnoreDriverChecks,Vulkan,DefaultANGLEVulkan,VulkanFromANGLE,VaapiOnNvidiaGPUs
    ```
    To make this permanent, see [Tips & Tricks - Making Command Line Flags Permanent](/wiki/linux/tips).
    
## Equibop Arguments

If you need to customize how Equibop runs, you can pass arguments directly via the terminal or through the application settings at `Settings > Equibop Settings > Arguments > Configure`.

### **Wayland Support**

```bash
--wayland
```

This is a shortcut flag that forces the application to use the **Ozone Wayland** platform. It automatically enables:

* `WaylandWindowDecorations`
* `VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL` (Hardware acceleration)
> **Note:** You can still use the manual string:
> `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`

### **Security & Performance**

```bash
--no-sandbox
```

Disables the Chromium sandbox. This is generally discouraged for security reasons but is often required when the application is executed as **root**.

```bash
--force_high_performance_gpu
```

Instructs the graphics engine to ignore integrated graphics and prioritize the discrete (high-performance) GPU.

### Persistent Configuration File

Rather than relying on Equibop Settings, the launcher supports reading arguments from a persistent configuration file.

**File Path:**

`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/equibop-flags.conf`

**Usage Rules:**

* **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
* **Spacing:** Empty lines are ignored.
* **Execution:** All valid entries in this file are automatically appended to the execution command when you start Equibop.
